##       <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="6" page="1" column="1">MAURITIUS is one of a group of three volcanic islands situated in the South Indian Ocean. It is in latitude 20Â° S., about 500 miles east of Madagascar. The area of the island is approximately 700 square miles, of which 216 square miles are under sugar-cane. The original vegetation of the island has been very largely destroyed, and replaced by scrubs and thickets of exotic species. The first attempt at a flora was the 'Hortus Mauritianus' by W. Bojer, published in 1837. Bojer enumerated the exotic and indigenous plants of the island, gave some account of their distribution, and named, but did not describe, a number of new species. His work was based on material gathered by Thouars, Commerson, and Sieber, and on extensive collections and observations made by himself during his long residence in the island. During the following decades, principally from 1860-65, L. Bouton and P. H. Ayres collected important material, and the latter prepared a ' Flora ' of the island in manuscript. This, together with his collections and those of Bouton, was sent to Kew for the compilation of J. G. Baker's 'Flora of Mauritius and the Seychelles ', which was published in 1877. Johnston (1895), during a residence of over three years in the island from 1887 to 1890, made further contributions to our knowledge of the flora. He collected seventy-eight species of flowering plants not recorded in Baker's 'Flora', of which twenty-five were native. He also investigated and described the flora of the islets surrounding the mainland. Baker's 'Flora ', which is the only standard work on the subject, is now inadequate on account of the large number of native and naturalized species which have been discovered during the last sixty years. An account is given in this paper of the naturalized flowering plants which have been recorded from the island since the publication of Baker's 'Flora' in 1877. The new native species will form the subject of a further communica- tion. The number of species here recorded is 139. These may be conveniently divided into two groups as follows : - 1. Immigrant species . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 82 2.

##       <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="10" confidence="possible" page="2" column="1">The plants comprising the first gTOUp are for the most part fairly common, and have accessible, though in some cases restricted, habitats. It is therefore safe to assume that in the large majority of cases they have not been over- looked by former collectors, but have arrived during the last 60 years. Their present distribution and country of origin is for this reason a matter of some interest. It is probable that a very large number of seeds from all parts of the world are continually reaching the island. They may be introduced by various means-on clothing of passengers disembarking on the island, with rice from India, in packets of seeds for cultivation, and so on. Some of them have better opportunities for arriving than others, particularly on account of the geo- graphical position of the island. Most of the shipping calling at Mauritius comes from European ports via South and East Africa, and a much smaller proportion from India and the Far East. It might be expected therefore that plants from Europe and Africa would be prevalent among those newly established. A distribution-table of the invading species throws some light on this point. In the following table the first column gives the native country of the species, while the second shows the present range of the species excluding their native country. The third column indicates the native country of those species which have become established in the Mascarenes (including Madagascar), but not elsewhere : -</region>

The European immigrants are well represented, but there is a marked predominance of species from America and Asia. In considering the manner in which the immigrant species have reached the island, a distinction between species which are restricted in range and those which are widely diffused is important.

##       <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="35" page="3" column="1">species 12 are now pantropical and may have reached the island from some other country, possibly Africa or Asia. This is well illustrated in the case of Acizntlwspermum hispidum DC., an American species which appeared in S. Africa in 1915 and was found in Mauritius ten years later. Again, Nicotiana plum- ba{/inifolia Viv., another American species, has been established in India for many years and has probably been introduced from there into Mauritius. Further, seeds with special devices for dispersal would seem to have a better opportunity of reaching the island and becoming established. Some of the immigrant species have very small seeds, which are rapidly conveyed from place to place, especially those belonging to the Gramineae. Apart from the grasses, however, it is found that, out of 58 species, only 3 have seeds armed with spines, hooks, or similar modifications for distribution as external passengers. These species are Acanthospermum hispidum DC., Emex spinosa Campd., and Medicago denticulata Willd. They are now all widespread, and none is restricted to the Mascarenes alone. It is evident that among the large number of seeds of foreign species reaching the island only a very small proportion are likely to become naturalized. The ability of a species to survive and become established in the new environment must depend therefore upon the interaction of various complex and closely interwoven factors, some of which may be enumerated as follows :-( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="25" class="deo:Reference">1</xref>) Macro- biotic seeds, since they may not be able to find a suitable nidus for germination for some time after arrival. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="26" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>) A good germinating capacity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="27" class="deo:Reference">3</xref>) Power to compete s1rncessfully with other species already established. (4) Ability of the plant to adapt itself to the climatic conditions of the island, which may differ widely from those of its native country. (5) An effective method of seed- dispersal within the island. Since so little correlation is found between the country of origin of the new species and the trade-routes, it is probable that the initial advantages of having easier access to the island, or of possessing special modifications for seed- distribution, are masked by the absence in the plants' make-up of the factors contributing to successful naturalization. Short descriptive notes are given with most species except the Cyperaceae and Gramineae, a full account of which will shortly be published elsewhere.
